## 7. Migration Strategy

1. **Setup development environment** with Flutter and necessary tools
2. **Develop core infrastructure** including API clients, entities, and repositories
3. **Create basic UI components** and page structure
4. **Implement feature by feature** starting with most critical functionality
5. **Test thoroughly** on multiple devices
6. **Deploy the application** on target platforms

## 8. Deployment Considerations

- Web deployment for desktop access
- Mobile app distribution via app stores
- Backend integration with existing APIs
- API key and credential management
